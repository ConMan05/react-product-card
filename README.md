### REACTJS + SCSS TEMPLATE SITE

- ITCSS
- REDUX + THUNK
- REACT-ROUTER-DOM
- SERVICE-WORKER
- THEMING
- CLI SUPPORT TO CREATE XYZ
- ANIMATION (GSAP)

* REDUX CODE IS REPETITIVE AND MANY FILES CAN BE INITIATED SIMILARLY LIKE

- ARRAY OF SOMETHINGS (Eg. ProfileCards )

1. Similar Types -> ADD, UPDATE, DELETE
2. Similar Actions -> ...
3. Similar utils for it (manipulating array -> adding a card , updating a card etc)

- So this can be (i hope) mostly auto generated using cli-tools

* NEED A FRONT PAGE AS DOCUMENTATION + PRESENTATION FOR THIS BP

- CURRENT TASKS

* A way to create similar redux structure using cli
